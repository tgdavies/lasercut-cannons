This project allows you to generate DXF files for laser cutting Big Gun cannon magazine/breech assemblies, of the pattern [described here](http://www.rcnavalcombat.com/Forum/tabid/58/aff/535/aft/441794/afv/topic/Default.aspxa).

Note that I have no actual experience building cannon, so caveat emptor.

To create your cannon, first edit the `params.scad` file to customise the design for your ship. You can load `exploded.scad` into the OpenSCAD GUI to check what your paremeter values make.

When you are ready to create your DXF files run `build.sh`.
